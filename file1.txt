Fully-actuated vs Underactuated Systems
Many robots today move far too conservatively, and accomplish only a fraction of the tasks and achieve a fraction of the performance that they are mechanically capable of. In some cases, we are still fundamentally limited by control technology which matured on rigid robotic arms in structured factory environments, where large actuators could be used to "shape" the dynamics of the machine to achieve precision and repeatability. The study of underactuated robotics focuses on building control systems which instead exploit the natural dynamics of the machines in an attempt to achieve extraordinary performance in terms of speed, efficiency, or robustness.

In the last few years, controllers designed using machine learning have showcased the potential power of optimization-based control, but these methods do not yet enjoy the sample-efficiency nor algorithmic reliability that we've come to expect from more mature control technologies. The study of underactuated robotics asks us to look closely at the optimization landscapes that occur when we are optimizing mechanical systems, to understand and exploit that structure in our optimization and learning algorithms.

Let's start with some examples, and some videos.

Honda's ASIMO vs. passive dynamic walkers
The world of robotics changed when, in late 1996, Honda Motor Co. announced that they had been working for nearly 15 years (behind closed doors) on walking robot technology. Their designs have continued to evolve, resulting in a humanoid robot they call ASIMO (Advanced Step in Innovative MObility). For nearly 20 years, Honda's robots were widely considered to represent the state of the art in walking robots, although there are now many robots with designs and performance very similar to ASIMO's. We will dedicate effort to understanding a few of the details of ASIMO when we discuss algorithms for walking... for now I just want you to become familiar with the look and feel of ASIMO's movements [watch the asimo video below now].
